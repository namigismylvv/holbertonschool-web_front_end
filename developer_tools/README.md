# Developer Tools Project

This project focuses on exploring and using browser Developer Tools to analyze and manipulate web pages. The target site for analysis is: [https://dev-tools.hbtn.info/](https://dev-tools.hbtn.info/)

## Tasks Overview

- Used Chrome DevTools (latest version) to inspect and interact with different page elements.
- Performed responsiveness testing with the device toolbar (iPhone X).
- Edited HTML and CSS in the Elements panel (e.g., changed background color of body, manipulated hover state).
- Extracted all applied styles from specific buttons using the Styles tab.
- Modified styles globally using the Console.
- Merged and captured screenshots for visual confirmation of changes.
- Removed elements from the DOM using DevTools.
- Located the file source of CSS properties (e.g., `margin-bottom` for `<h2>` from `freelance.css`).
- Identified icon font libraries used (Font Awesome).
- Inspected network activity, including identifying XHR calls.
- Used Lighthouse to evaluate performance, SEO, and accessibility metrics.
- Determined elements with missing alt or text descriptions via the Accessibility panel.
- Explored the Sources panel: created and executed custom JavaScript snippets (e.g., `allcolors.js`).
- Blocked CSS requests using the Network conditions tab.
- Checked session storage and found keys and values.
- Verified that no service workers were registered for the page.
- Identified SSL certificate issuer via the Security panel.
