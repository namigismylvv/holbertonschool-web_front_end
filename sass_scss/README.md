# Sass/SCSS Exercises â€“ Holberton School

This project contains a series of Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) exercises designed to build your skills in using variables, mixins, loops, conditionals, functions, and media queries in SCSS. The tasks gradually increase in difficulty, ranging from basic syntax to more advanced concepts like list sorting and responsive design.

## Key Concepts Practiced

- Variables and basic SCSS syntax  
- Mixins and parameterization  
- Nested selectors and scope  
- Looping with `@for` and `@each`  
- Conditional logic with `@if` and `@else`  
- Responsive design with `@media` queries  
- Debugging using the `@debug` directive  
- Basic list operations and sorting in SCSS

## File Naming Convention

Files are named sequentially (e.g., `0-debug_log.scss`, `12-loop_header.scss`, `100-loop_col.scss`, etc.) to match the corresponding task numbers. Some tasks are located in an `advanced` section and may involve more complex logic like implementing a sort algorithm using loops.

## Usage

You can compile any of the `.scss` files to CSS using the `sass` command:

```bash
sass filename.scss
